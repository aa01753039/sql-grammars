Finally select those emails whose female have lower than their corresponding male counterparts rate...

If you want results based only stocks then replace query accordingly; if also wanted result about where was opened each shop consider adding date open field into your schema too.. This will give more

So I am assuming your question wants me to return top five types? If yes then how many instances do they have ? And what would be their names if any?.

Therefore none of them have an associated Client in this database system and hence they do not exist on that basis either from our perspective or data integrity standpoint because there is nothing to join against it ie., we can say those rows don’t belong anywhere else than just being part of another row which has been excluded by other conditions like invoicing status etc.. So these would be considered non-existent entries too based upon what I understand about your question here... Anyway thank you very much if my explanation was clear enough so far :) Please let me know how should further assistance come next time? Thank You Very Much For
