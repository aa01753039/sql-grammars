 to this problem may vary depending on the specific use case. However, assuming that all possible order statuses are stored in the 'order_status_code' column of the 'Orders' table, a query could look like:SELECT o.order_status_code, COUNT(*) as countFROM Orders oGROUP BY o.order_status_codeORDER BY o.order_status_code DESCLIMIT 1;<|im_
 user, your query is missing a few things. It seems like you need to join orders with products and customer to get the product name for each order. You also need to filter out any statuses that only occur in one invoice, as those are not relevant to the commonality question.

The answer is: SELECT SUM(quantity) FROM stock WHERE store.name = 'Woodman';

It looks like you're trying to find the neighborhoods that don't have any headphones in stock. To do this, we can use a LEFT JOIN to join the store and stock tables and filter out rows where the quantity is 0 for each headphone. Then, we group by the neighborhood and filter out those that don't have any headphones at all by counting distinct headphone ids and making sure it's equal to 0.<|im_end

 database schema looks correct and the question asks for a single record with the id 70. However, there is no table named "goods" in the schema provided. Assuming that there is a mistake in the question and it should be "Id" instead of "food", here's the SQL query:SELECT goods.PriceFROM goodsWHERE goods.Id = '70';

 user, I believe you meant to ask "What is the position of a physician?" To answer that question, we can use the following SQL query:```sqlSELECT Position FROM Employee WHERE Name = 'Physician' LIMIT 1;```
.clearance_level(employee) AS clr SELECT h.level FROM has_clearance h WHERE h.employee = employee AND h.planet IN (SELECT p.planetid FROM planet p JOIN shipment s ON p.coordinates = s.coordinates JOIN employee e ON s.manager = e.employeeid AND position LIKE '%Physician%')[/SQL]
 user, I assume you meant "Leo Wong" instead of "Leo" in your question. Here's the SQL query to list all package numbers sent by Leo Wong:```sqlSELECT p.PackageNumberFROM Package pJOIN Shipment s ON p.ShipMENT = s.ShipMENT_IDJOIN Employee e ON s.Manager = e.EmployeeIDWHERE e.Name = 'Leo Wong';
 to your SQL query: SELECT COUNT(PackageNumber) FROM Package WHERE Sender = (SELECT EmployeeID FROM Employee WHERE Name = 'Leo Wong');

 user, I assume you meant "Leo Wong" instead of "Leo wong"?<br>If so, the SQL query to list all packages sent or received by Leo Wong is:```sqlSELECT p.Contents, s.Name AS sender_name, r.name AS recipient_nameFROM Package pJOIN Client s ON p.sender = s.accountnumberJOIN Client r ON p.recipient = r

 user,<br>The following SQL query can be used to answer the question.<br>
 user>The name of the client who sent the most packages and the number of packages they sent can be obtained by joining the `Client` table with the `Package` table on the `AccountNumber` field, then grouping by the `Sender` column in the `Package` table and using the `COUNT(*)` function to get the number of packages for each client and ordering the result by the number of packages sent in descending order. The query would look like this:<|
 to your question, here's the SQL query to find the client who received the least number of packages and the corresponding number of packages received:SELECT c.name AS client_name, COUNT(p.package_number) AS num_packagesFROM package pJOIN client c ON p.recipient = c.account_numberGROUP BY c.account_numberORDER BY num_packages ASCLIMIT 1;<|im_end|

The name of the author of the best selling book can be obtained by joining the `author` and `book` tables with a `GROUP BY` clause to get the total sales amount for each author and then using a subquery to find the maximum sales amount and matching its corresponding author.

 user, it's not clear what you mean by "How many invoices are there for each client id?" Are you asking how many invoices a client has or how many invoices there are for each client id in the database? Here's the answer to both:
