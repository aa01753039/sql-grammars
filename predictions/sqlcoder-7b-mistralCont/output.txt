I think you mean "What is the description of collection named Best?" Is that correct? Here's the SQL query for that:```sqlSELECT Collections.Collection_DescriptionFROM CollectionsJOIN Documents_in_Collections ON Collections.Collection_ID = Documents_in_Collections.Collection_IDWHERE Collections.Collection_Name = 'Best';```This query assumes the collection named "Best" exists in the database, otherwise it

To get the name of the parent collection of the collection named "Nice", we can use the following SQL query:SELECT Collections.Collection_Name FROM Collections WHERE Collections.Collection_ID = (SELECT Document_Objects.Parent_Collection_ID FROM Document_Objects WHERE Document_Objects.Document_Object_ID = (SELECT Documents_in_Collections.Document_Object_ID FROM Documents_in_Collections WHERE Documents_in_Collections.Collection_ID =

You'll need to join the `Collections` table with the `Document_Objects` table and the `Document_Subsets` table using their respective IDs. Then use a LEFT JOIN to include all collections, even those that don't have a document in them. Finally, filter out collections where the parent collection is one of the collections being checked for:<|im_end|>```sqlSELECT c.Collection_NameFROM Collections c

This seems to be a recursive relationship between the Document_Objects and Collections tables, where each document can have multiple parent collections, and each collection can contain multiple documents.

That is a standard database schema for a document management system.

It seems that the database contains a table named 'headphone' with 4 attributes: 'Headphone_ID', 'Model', 'Class', and 'Price'. It also contains two other tables: 'store' and 'stock', which have the primary keys 'Store_ID' and 'Headphone_ID', respectively.

I see that you have a schema for headphones and stores. You'll want to use the `stock` table to check which stores do not have any headphones in stock.

It seems that you have a database with three tables: headphones, stores and stock.

It is possible to filter pilots by age using the `age` column in the table PilotSkills.

I see, the table "official_languages" is a many-to-many relationship between "languages" and "countries", which means that each language can be an official language in multiple countries and each country can have multiple official languages.<br><br>Here's a possible query for you:<|im_end|>SELECT languages.name, COUNT(DISTINCT countries.id) as number_of_countries FROM languages

To get the official language spoken by the most number of countries, you can use the following query:SELECT languages.name FROM languages JOIN (SELECT countries.name, COUNT(official_languages.language_id) as count FROM official_languages GROUP BY official_languages.country_id HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country_id) FROM offical_languages) ORDER

To get the list of countries that do not have any official language, we can join the "languages" and "countries" tables with a LEFT JOIN on the "official_languages" table to filter out any rows where the country does not exist in the "official_languages" table for a specific id. We can then use COUNT(*) to check if there are any languages registered for that country, and compare it with the total number of countries

_query="SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Boxes.Warehouse) FROM Boxes WHERE Contents = 'Rocks';"[/assistant_query]<|im_end|>The SQL query to answer the question is: `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Boxes.Warehouse) FROM Boxes WHERE Contents = 'Rocks';`
The following SQL query should be used to answer the question: `SELECT Boxes.Code, Cities.Name FROM Boxes JOIN Warehouses ON Boxes.Warehouse = Warehouses.Code JOIN Cities ON Warehouses.Location = Cities.Name;<|im_end|>
```sqlSELECT Boxes.Code, Warehouses.Location FROM Boxes JOIN Warehouses ON Boxes.Warehouse = Warehouses.Code;```<|im_end|>

|systemHere's the SQL query to answer your question:SELECT Boxes.Code FROM Boxes JOIN Warehouses ON Boxes.Warehouse = Warehouses.Code WHERE Warehouses.Location = 'Chicago';<|im_end|>
I would assume you want to find the number of boxes in each warehouse. Here is a possible query:```sqlSELECT w.location, COUNT(b.code) as num_boxes, SUM(b.value) as total_value FROM warehouses w JOIN boxes b ON w.code = b.warehouse GROUP BY w.location;<|im_end|>
To find the number of boxes in each warehouse, you can use a JOIN clause to connect the Boxes and Warehouses tables together based on their common column (Warehouse), then apply COUNT(*) to count the number of rows (boxes) that match the query:<|im_end|>```sqlSELECT Warehouses.Location, COUNT(Boxes.Code) AS NumberOfBoxes FROM Warehouses JOIN

I think it's a good start, but I'm not sure if we can just select author.name and author.gender from the author table directly. We need to join with the book table to count the number of books for each author, and then group by their name and gender.<|im_end|><|im_start|>user### SQL Query```sqlSELECT a.name, a.gender FROM author a JOIN (SELECT
This seems to be a simple query, but let's double check that we are clear on the requirement. You want to find out who wrote the largest number of books? That means the author with the most Book_IDs in the `book` table. Got it. Here is the query:```SELECT a.Name, a.Gender FROM author a JOIN book b ON a.Author_ID = b.Author_ID GROUP BY a.Name
@420Query>SELECT a.name  FROM author a LEFT JOIN book b ON a.author_id = b.author_id AND b.press_id NOT IN (SELECT press_id FROM press WHERE name LIKE '%accor%');<|im_end|>
@savoir.comThe SQL query would look like this:```sqlSELECT a.NameFROM author aWHERE NOT EXISTS (    SELECT 1    FROM book b JOIN press p ON b.Press_ID = p.Press_ID    WHERE a.Author_ID = b.Author_ID AND p.Name = 'Accor')```<|im_end|>
Your SQL query should return the name of presses that published more than two books, along with their yearly profits in billions of dollars.<|im_end|>SELECT p.Name AS press_name, SUM(b.Sale_Amount) / 1000000000000 AS yearly_profit_in_billion FROM book b JOIN press p ON b.Press_ID = p.Press
I believe that you should use a subquery and the GROUP BY clause, but I'm not sure about the exact syntax. Try something like this:```sqlSELECT p.name as press_name, SUM(b.sale_amount) as total_sales, (Year_Profits_billion + Month_Profits_billion) as total_profits_billion FROM press p JOIN book b ON p
