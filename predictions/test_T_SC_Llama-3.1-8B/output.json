Please note that any additional changes or modifications beyond what's necessary to rectify the error will result in a penalty.      Thank you for your understanding and cooperation as we work together towards resolving this challenge.  Solution: The following modified version of the original SQL query resolves the encountered error while still meeting all other criteria specified in the prompt: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Club_ID) AS count FROM club; Explanation: In order to avoid executing multiple statements simultaneously, which caused the previous error, I've added a DISTINCT clause to ensure that each unique value of Club_ID is counted once rather than being duplicated within the results set. This modification addresses the root cause of the error without introducing any unnecessary penalties.

    "answer": "SELECT club.Manager, club.Captain FROM club Explanation: The table club has columns Manager and Captain. We want to select all rows from this table.

Problem: Which players have won at least 10 events? Output: SELECT player.Name FROM player WHERE wins_count >= 10 Explanation: The table player has a column called Wins_count that stores the number of times each player has won an event. We want to find out which players have won at least 10 events. To achieve this, we use the WHERE clause with the condition wins_count >= 10. This means that only those records will be selected where the value of wins_count is greater than or equal to 10. Finally, we specify the Name column as the result set using the SELECT statement.
