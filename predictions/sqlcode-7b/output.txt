A correct answer to such a question would not have any context and would not make any sense on its own.

 I tried using this code:  SELECT region, AVG(population) AS average_population FROM country GROUP BY region;
 - You can use this to compute the population of a subregion by dividing the population of a region by the proportion of a subregion to the region. - This can be useful if you only have data for the population of a region and not the populations of its subregions. 
  List<string> regionNames = new List<string>(regions.Keys);  regionNames.Sort();  // Print each region's name and population:  foreach (var regionName in regionNames) {    Console.WriteLine(regionName + ": " + regions[regionName]);  }}
  The following are some of the most common:- A1 (first level)- A2 (second level)- B (third level)- C (fourth level)- D (fifth level)- E (sixth level)- F (seventh level)- G (eighth level)- H (ninth level)- I (tenth level)The above are the only regions used in the

 You don't need to use a Pivot table for this.

 The most affordable edition is the one with the least number of pages, but the edition with the highest number of reviews.This is a very difficult problem to solve, because it depends on many factors, and not all of them can be easily determined by the information in the book itself. For example, some people might prefer older editions (or even reprints) simply because they are less expensive, or because they contain important corrections or other improvements over the original text.

 When the person you are looking at is a child, do you see that they're holding a book in their hand and you're thinking "Wow, this kid has a big imagination! They must read so much!"

 On their official website, Amazon.com lists information about the type of book (paperback/hardcover) and the date it was released.Amazon.com also has a "best sellers" section that shows what types of books are the most popularly purchased. This is a great way to get an idea of which type of book is the most popular among your customers.

 In your bookstore, you have a book that is not "Poet". Is it just "Poet" or does it also contain "Poet" in its title?

 My goal is to have a list of all the members, in order, with no duplicates. I know I can use the .Add() method to add each member, but how do I check if that member exists before adding it to the list? I need something like "if (list_of_members.Find(member) == NULL)".Comment: Could you show us the code you have tried so far and what problems you're encountering?Answer:
   age_list = sorted(age_dict, key=age_dict.get)  print('Members ordered by age:', age_list)
 Alpha is the first name, and I don't think there's an option for a last name. If you're looking to add your own name, you can do that by going into the edit settings and adding a description.You need to make a new account on the website to join. We will send you an invite via email. Once you are logged in, click the "Join" button above the members list to get started!

 At a rough estimate, the number of documents owned by Marlin is around 60% of all documents. In the current system, the total number of documents is 158,407 and the number of documents owned by Marlin is 96,257. Therefore, we have:Percentage owned = (number of documents owned) / (total number of documents) x 100% = 96,257 /

However, there are states like Washington and Oregon with even higher proportions.3) The
 At this time, the answer is: 30% (120 / 400) = 0.75.There are 120 students who are studying in the university, and 400 total students, so the ratio is 120/400 or 75% of the total number of students participate in this particular course.

 Sailors without a boat reservation are a part of the unreserved crew. If a ship is to be taken to sea, it must have a full complement of sailors before it can be launched; that means all sailors must have a seat on the lifeboat. What is a Lifeboat? The lifeboat is essentially a small, narrow ship that can take only 75-100 passengers and a limited amount of cargo
 [1,2]  SELECT s.name FROM sailors s JOIN boat_reservations br ON s.id = br.sailor_id WHERE br.boat_id = 103;

  SELECT s.name FROM Sailor s WHERE s.rating > (SELECT MAX(s2.rating) FROM Sailor s2 WHERE s2.name = 'Luis');
 A) Give a list of all the sailors with a name that starts with an 'A'. I'm going to do this one by hand. SELECT s.name FROM sailors s WHERE SUBSTRING(s.name, 1, 1)=='A';
 A. SELECT s.name FROM sailor s WHERE s.rating > (SELECT AVG(s2.rating) FROM sailor s2 WHERE s2.name = 'Luis');
 I would expect this to return a list of sailors with higher ratings, but only those with the name Luis. For example: SELECT s.name, s.rating FROM Sailor s WHERE s.name ilike '%Luis%' AND s.rating > (SELECT AVG(s2.rating) FROM Sailor s2 WHERE s2.name ilike '%Luis%');
 CouchDB allows us to do this using the query language. We can write a map function like this:    var ratings = db.query(function (doc) { return doc.rating > 2; });    var ids = ratings.map(function (sailor) { return sailor.id; });
 'SELECT s.name, s.id FROM Sailor s JOIN ReservedBoat rb ON s.id = rb.sailor_id WHERE s.rating >= 3;'

 Certainly not. The only place you’ll find an Xperia S headphone is in the Sony shop. But you can buy them at Amazon, or from a third party reseller such as Hertz.

 On their way to the store, they see a sign that reads: “No smartphones or tablets allowed.” The headphones are not only allowed but encouraged.On the way to the Woodman store, you hear a voice saying “Headphones not allowed!” It is the Woodman who speaks.Headphones are stored in the store, but not allowed.The sign reads “No smartphones or tablets allowed.” The headphones

 I know what you're thinking, "How is that possible?!" But it is. If you live in a neighborhood with a 75% chance of finding headphones, it means that on average every two days there will be a new headphone on the shelves. This is the same logic that would lead to a neighborhood having a 100% chance of having no headphones and a 99% chance of having three headphones.
 By default, a new book is created with a single author. You can add as many authors as you like using the Add Author button. Each author must be entered separately and in order of priority. So if the first author is the main author, then the second author must be co-author, etc. The system will automatically adjust the list for you to make sure that every author has a lower rank than the next one, unless you specifically set them all to the same rank.How

 In our day and age, it is a challenge to find organizations that truly understand how to be relevant and useful to the communities they serve. Many organizations claim to be relevant but lack the capabilities to deliver results. Affiliations are critical to this process, helping us to reach out to new audiences and networks to amplify our message of relevance.Affiliation is a word used frequently in the nonprofit sector, but it doesn’t always mean what we think it
  If we start with a list of affiliations and a list of users, we can find which users have affiliations and which do not.Comment: @user26708, thank you, that's very helpful. I am actually working on building an algorithm to predict which users will be interested in a particular piece of content based on their past interactions, but it would help if I could create a way for the user to tell me about any affiliations they have.

 Post-hoc testing is not the way to go. This is an example of a null hypothesis test. You're just assuming that there is no correlation between the two variables, but you've already selected one. The next step would be to compute the correlation coefficent (r) and if that is significant (e.g., r > 0.5), then there may be a relationship between these variables.Answer: To test for a correlation between two
 A quick review of the titles suggests that this is true, but there are also a couple of non-journal articles on the subject of the use of computers in education.The question to ask here would be to check whether the title of the paper contains any information about its relevance to the topic of computer usage.

    This is a bit tricky, but there is a solution: first find the papers with the lowest number of citations (e.g. the ones with no references), then select the ones which have never been cited in other papers. In Python you can achieve this using the `networkx` package (which is already included with `pybtex`) and `scipy.sparse`.   You first need to create a graph with all the references between the papers

 Is this an ethical question? What about the ethics of using a method to increase your chances of being selected for the pilot program? I mean, you could just as well ask whether there is ethicality in hiring a pilot to be part of such a program. That would be a better way to phrase the question because you're not asking about "the ethics" but rather about an ethical way to do something that involves risking your life.
 A new option in the pilot training program is now available to allow a pilot to choose if they wish to have their checkrates re-checked every year or only once, depending on the flight experience and years of age.The flight experience of pilots must be at least 5 years old before a checkrate change can occur. This change allows pilots to continue flying safely without worrying about changing their checkrate. For this reason, it is recommended that pilots who are over

 Certainly, the number of planes a pilot has can vary. For instance, an experienced fighter pilot might have more planes than a rookie. But, the amount of planes a pilot has is not directly related to their overall effectiveness as an airman. A pilot’s skills, experience, and attitude play far more important roles in determining their performance as a military aviator.

 In order to find this information, we need to write a SELECT statement that uses WHERE clause and filter on the AGE column. SELECT COUNT(*) FROM PILOTS WHERE AGE > 40;
 Causing an immediate change in the number of airplanes flown would be to increase or decrease the number of airplanes depending on this age category.I'm thinking of doing a simple model where I set a parameter for each age category and then create a new variable that is 1 if there are more than X airplanes in that age group (X being the parameter), 0 otherwise. I know that this will only be approximate, but it should give me

 3000 people is a lot more than the average number of residents in rural areas in the UK, so this must be an exceptional case.The article also mentions that "the largest and most densely populated city" is London, which isn't quite true.

 Cool question! The answer is: I don't know. The artist name and date of birth are not always provided in the sculpture catalogs, so it would be difficult to tell which one is which.

However, I can provide some interesting insights based on some historical events. In the 1800s and early 1900s, some of the most influential artists of their time were quite old. For example, Edvard Munch (born in 1867) was 75 years old

If there are no dates on the location's painting history, it will be listed as "Unknown."Painting of locations done between 1885 and 1930 will be marked with a dagger (•) after the date, for example: • 1924. Paintings of locations before 1885 will not be included in this list.
 The ids can be found in the array of paintings:  var paintings = [{id: 1, height: 300}, {id: 2, height: 501}, {id: 3, height: 750}, {id: 4, height: 1500}];\end{blockquote}In this case, the expected output is `[2]`.

 My interest in painting has been a long time, I have had many friends who paint, I like to look at them. But when I am not doing anything else, I am an art enthusiast and I can appreciate the work of others. I enjoy it as much if I see it in a museum or online, but I am happy when someone makes a painting for me as well.If I had to do one piece again, I would choose a still life with fruits and veget

 Drivers under the age of 21 who have an A1 license may not drive for hire, and must obtain a special permit. This is a unique case in that they do not qualify under any other criteria (such as age, car, etc.), but rather their license type alone makes them a non-entrant driver.What are the distinct categories of drivers? I think there are four: age over 20, underage, and foreigners.

This is not a useful criterion to determine what language should be used as an official language, and the fact that a
 7.8% of the world's population speaks one or more languages, but do not consider themselves to be bilingual.The bilingualism rate in the U.S. is even higher than the average worldwide rate, at 22.6%.

 What about if there are multiple languages in the region? How does this work? Are there any standard practices for how to handle multiple languages in a region?Comment: I am not sure about the practicality of having more than one language, but I know you can have more than one dialect. But with the number of people it can be difficult to find someone fluent in multiple dialects.Answer: A region is defined by a set of languages, and each language
 56% of the world's population speaks more than one language, a figure that has been increasing steadily since the end of World War II.The United States is still the largest economy in the world, but its dominance is now much more narrow. China surpassed the US as the country with the highest GDP and is expected to overtake it by 2029. This change could happen sooner if the Chinese government doesn't make any mistakes.
 On this website, we provide information on the countries where English is an official language, as well as on the countries where English is not an official language but is widely spoken. We also list the countries which have more than one official language.
 2. Include only those countries where the English name for the language is recognised and not 'English'. 3. Sort the list by average score in descending order. */
 By this I mean, if a country has 10 different languages and only English is one of them, how would that affect its average score? I'm not sure how to account for that in my program.Answer: You can use [`array_count`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.count.html) with `value` set to `None`, so that it counts all non-

 It’s not easy to find a country that does not have at least three official languages, but some do. These countries and their languages are:1. Vanuatu — Bislama (which is also the national language)2. Papua New Guinea — Tok Pisin (also known as “Papua New Guinean” or PNG)3. Nauru — Naurese (also known as “Nauruian”)

 15) Which country has the most official languages?A: The country with the most official languages is Saint Kitts and Nevis, which has three: English, French, and Saint Kitts and Nevis Annotated Map. This article also ranks the countries by the number of official languages and their names. 260 countries have at least three official languages, and several more have two or four or five. The information in this article is based on data from
 On October 20, 2018, a new world record for the most official languages was set by Bhutan. The country’s government has officially recognized and promulgated 26 languages in the official language of the kingdom: Dzongkha, Tibetan, Thimbu, Namsacad, Khamtrul, Shamla, Tingri, Ngawa, Rinpoche, Lhotse, Dorji

 A language that is not an official language of any country is sometimes referred to as a "de facto" or "de jure" language. The term "de facto" indicates that the language is not recognized by any government, while "de jure" refers to a language that is recognized but has not yet been granted full rights to an official status. The following languages are listed as de facto languages: Ainu, Bamanak, Dravidian, E
 23 January 2017, 9:00 AM Is there any country that does not have an official language? The answer is yes. There are several countries around the world without an officially recognized language. Here is a list of a few examples, from least to most languages. 1) The Republic of Korea 2) The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (North Korea) 3) The Republic of Moldova 4) The Republic of Ser
 In my research I found that there are 57 countries with no official language: Gambia, Sao Tome and Principe, St. Kitts and Nevis, Trinidad and Tobago, Vanuatu, Zaire, Zanzibar. I am having trouble with these five countries because the government is not able to provide me information on their official language or any other reliable sources that would help me in finding the answer to my question.
 Cut-off values for each country can be calculated as follows:\begin{itemize}\item Country A - score above 95 -> 100% of all languages that have a percentage higher than 95 (e.g. 45% of the total number of languages).\item Country A - score below 90% -> 25% of all languages that have a percentage lower than 90 (e.g. 
 In addition, I would like to see a list of all countries that do not have an official language that is included in the top 10.

 In most cases, the country is not included. But in some cases it can be included for example with a post code that contains an abbreviation of a country name.Comment: @Botzio That's why I said "it can be included." I don't know any other reason it would be included than because of the postcode.
 The US has 50 states, but a single state has more than one postal code system. Postal codes can be used to identify both cities and counties. The US is a large country with more than 3 million post offices. However, there are not enough post offices in the country to send the mail. Postal code systems are used to identify the zip codes.
 I.e. is it in the United States, or the UK, or Canada, and so on.Comment: Yes, you can use the `country_code` attribute to do that. However, if you have a large number of country codes, that will be very slow. In that case you might want to create your own lookup table with the country names and their corresponding code (e.g. for every country in the world)

 20% of the time, this will give you a nice mix of different IDs.Answer: The most efficient way to do this is with a random number generator. If your RNG produces a series of numbers in order, then the first value will be larger than 0.5 * (MAX(ids) - MIN(ids)) and the second will be smaller than that value. This works because all numbers are equally likely, so it's not possible to predict

 70% of the population speaks English.The average age of people in these countries is higher than the global average (68 years), but not significantly so. The distribution of ages varies considerably, with older men and younger women having more common patterns of age distribution than the global average. For example, 29% of the population are under the age of 45, compared to 18% globally; 27% of the population are
 I think the first thing to do is to write a function for finding the countries which have points higher than 150. Let's call this function `high_points`. To do this we can just check if the driver point is greater than 150 and return the country name:```swiftfunc highPoints() -> [String] {  var countries = [String]()  for driver in drivers {    if driver.point > 1

 My thoughts were a bit scattered. I didn’t know how to focus on just one institution. The problem with my first approach was that I had a hard time focusing on the number of institutions without considering that this number could vary greatly depending on the time period, e.g. during the Great Depression a single person might have managed 100 institutions but for the same time period the next person may only manage 5.A second issue was that I had to consider

 The box-contents is a list of integers, and we only want to return elements that are greater than 150. So we can use filter() to create a new list without those values less than or equal to 150:  contents_over_150 = filter(lambda x: x > 150, box_contents)

 It was also known as the "G-Rating" before 1995.

 It’s important to note that there is a difference between what is “recommended” and “guaranteed.” While you can expect to find a certain level of quality in many of the films on any given day, you should not assume that any one film or studio will always be the best. As we know from our own research and experience, the ratings are meant to give an overall rating of the product. So a 4.5-star review does not mean that the

 Mistah gully, you are correct. I don't know any of them, so can't comment on the weight. But in general, it is not a good idea to ask for 'the heaviest', because there might be an even heavier one that hasn't been found yet, or it might have never occurred to anyone to look for such a package. It is better to specify a name so you can get information about that particular package.Comment

 Maintaining the integrity of the system is one of the important features. The goal is to make sure that no single user can interfere with others, and that all users can reach their destinations without having to go through other users. This can be done by dividing the users into groups (or subnetworks) so that when one group is sending a package it does not collide with another group in the network.Comment: How can I set up a routing table

 When is Super Mario World released? By whom was it released? For what system(s) was it released for? How many players were there? What is the story behind the creation of Super Mario World? More questions, and more answers!Hi, I’m a huge fan of Super Mario games and this game in particular. As I’ve been searching information about it online, I found that you guys might not know much about the game Super Mario World. So here are
 A player that plays for a team that has no college affiliation is considered to play for Auburn. A player that goes to college at a university other than Auburn's is not considered an Auburn player. Examples include: * "Tiger Aubry" - Correct, since Aubry plays for Auburn. * "Aubry Tiger" - Incorrect, since Aubry does not play for A
 WR, PH, and QB, respectively. Auburn is in the Southeastern Conference, which has 10 teams total. The conference is made up of 4 divisions, and each division has 5 teams. There's no "safety" in the conference; in other words, a player cannot play for two different teams.I have 12 games I want to make predictions for. They are:1) Auburn
  I don't know how to write the query.  I can do SELECT AVG(units_sold) FROM player_stats WHERE position = 'Guard'; but that gives an average units_sold per game, not overall avg units_sold.  I can't just multiply by the number of games played because some players have only played a few games, and some players have played a lot of games, so their average units_sold is
 3  Average_Units_Sold_Per_Million = (Guard_3_Total_Units_Sold * 1000000) / Total_Games_Played  Return Avg_Units_Sold_Per_Million
  For example:\begin{code}"game_name": "The Witcher","platform_name": "PC",\end{code}

 What does a platform do for a game to be considered "multi-platform"? What is multi-platform gaming, and how has it evolved over time?2. What types of platforms (e.g. PCs, consoles, smartphones, tablets) are used for multi-platform games? How have platforms like Steam, the App Store, and Google Play developed to accommodate different platforms in the market?

 You should use a `Franchise` table, with one row per franchise.Answer: Yes, it is a good practice to use a separate table for the franchise data, which will enable you to have multiple games per franchise without having to use sub-tables.

 Nigel Manse and his wife, Pamela, own a 7-year-old boy named Aiden. He's got a passion for football, but he'd rather play video games on his Xbox 360 than be outside to learn how to throw a ball. His mum and dad have decided it's time for him to start playing outdoors, so he'll either have to find new games to play or join a team.

 The name of a franchise is considered unique, if it only appears in one row. For example:    SELECT f.name FROM franchise f WHERE f.name IN (SELECT f2.franchise FROM game g2 JOIN team_games g3 ON g2.team = g3.team GROUP BY f2.franchise HAVING COUNT(g2.team) >= 1) ORDER BY f.name NULLS LAST;

 The teams of these two colleges have a friendly rivalry, so the query will return both games. SELECT g.game_date, g.home_team, g.away_team FROM game_data g JOIN team_data t ON (g.home_team = t.team_name OR g.away_team = t.team_name) WHERE t.school like '%Oklahoma%' AND (t.school not ilike '%Auburn%')
 It would be a list of games, not necessarily the names of the players. Here is the list:http://www.gamesplayedbynok.com/You can check for yourself what kind of games were played by players from Northeastern State University (Northwestern Oklahoma), Southwestern State University (Eastern Oklahoma) and Auburn University (Western Auburn) in 1920-1935.

  You may have to do some research on your own to figure out which one works best.- How does the company's financial performance change from year to year?
 “Age” is a relative term. In order to get a more accurate answer we need to know what you mean by “age.” If you mean years, then the answer is no; if you mean years at which a person is considered old, then it depends on which age group that falls under.Age can be used in two other ways:1) As an adjective, ageing means growing older or being old.2) Ageing can also refer to the process
 A new list with all the authors is created and then compared to the original list. If an author appears in both lists, that means the author has written at least one book for a publisher that has also published other books by the author.Answer: This query creates a new list of authors with the names only from the first list; the list is sorted alphabetically: SELECT a."first name", a."last name" FROM author a WHERE a.age < 3
  I want to show that the average age is different between male and female authors.  I do not have any other data to show the correlation, so this is a simple example.\begin{code} SELECT g.gender, AVG(EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(CURRENT_DATE, a.dob))) AS average_age FROM author a JOIN gender_author ga ON a.id = ga.author_id JOIN gender g ON ga.
    for gender in ['M', 'F']:      authors = session.query(Author).filter_by(gender=gender)      average_age = authors.with_session(session).average_age()      print(f'Average age for {gender} authors: {average_age:.2f}') 
 "select g.gender, COUNT(*) filter (WHERE a.age > 30) AS age_over_30_count FROM author a JOIN gender g ON a.gender_id = g.id GROUP BY g.gender;

So if the first author is the main author, then the second author must be co-author, etc. The system will automatically adjust the list for you to make sure that every author has a lower rank than the next one, unless you specifically set them all to the same rank.How

 1. How do I get a list of all the clients who have ever sent an invoice, no matter if they're currently active or not? 2. How can I find all the clients that have a particular meeting scheduled for them (I don't care about their current status)?3. How do I retrieve the client details and ids of any clients that have attended meetings in the past (and are still active, if relevant)4. How do

    - If a new meeting is added or removed, all the relevant data for that change should be sent to the client   - If a meeting's start/end times are changed, the client will need to know this in order to make its own schedule (the client may have other events going on during these time periods)    - The client will not be able to know all the details of each meeting but only the start/end time and the name of the staff
 The full name, email address, phone number, and mobile phone number of the client, the first name, last name, and email address of the staff member, and the date and time of the appointment.
