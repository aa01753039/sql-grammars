Updated README file with instructions on how to build/run the project again using your local database. Details are also included for clarity. Finally, this update includes changesets which broke compatibility so you can get back into it by rollingback (undoing all of them). 310:54 PM--> Commit message<<<< HEAD stems from a merge conflict that I was resolving and have created the following commit to fix bugs in my code.
